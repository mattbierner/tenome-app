# Tenome
Prototyping iOS app used for some of my modded reality experiments, including:

* [Hands for eyes][hands] – Viewing the world through cameras mounted on my hands
* [All This Blood][blood] – Using my heartbeat to modulate my vision.
* [Others...][mr]

See the above posts for more details about these experiments, including information about the hardware and software used.

All the app does is load a webpage fullscreen in landscape orientation, with the added ability to record the screen.
